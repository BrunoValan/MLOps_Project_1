One of the most influential science fiction shows of all time is the TV show Star Trek, which first aired in the mid-1960s, approximately 60 years ago. The cultural impact inspired designers of technology like the Palm Pilot and hand-held cellular phones. In addition, Star Trek influenced the cofounder of Apple computer, Steve Wozniak, to create Apple computers. In this age of innovation in machine learning, there are many essential ideas from the original series relevant to the coming MLOps (or Machine Learning Operations) industrial revolution. For example, Star Trek hand-held tricorders can instantly classify objects using pretrained multiclass classification models. But, ultimately, in this futuristic science-fiction world, domain experts like the science officers, medical officers, or captain of the ship, don’t spend months training machine learning models. Likewise, the crew of their science vessel, the Enterprise, are not called data scientists. Instead, they have jobs where they often use data science. Many of the machine learning aspects of this Star Trek science fiction future are no longer science fiction in the 2020s. This chapter guides the reader into the foundational theory of how to make this possible. Let’s get started. Machine learning (ML), with its widespread adoption globally, has created a need for a systematic and efficient approach toward building ML systems, leading to a sudden rise in demand for ML engineers. These ML engineers, in turn, are applying established DevOps best practices to the emerging machine learning technologies. The major cloud vendors all have certifications targeting these practitioners. I have experience working directly with AWS, Azure, and GCP as a subject matter expert on machine learning. In some cases, this includes helping create machine learning certifications themselves and official training material. In addition, I teach machine learning engineering and cloud computing at some of the top data science programs with Duke and Northwestern. Firsthand, I have seen the rise in machine learning engineering as many former students have become machine learning engineers.Google has a Professional Machine Learning Engineer certification. It describes an ML engineer as someone who “designs, builds, and productionizes ML models to solve business challenges…” Azure has a Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Scientist Associate. It describes this type of practitioner as someone who “applies their knowledge of data science and machine learning to implement and run machine learning workloads…” Finally, AWS describes an AWS Certified Machine Learning specialist as someone with “the ability to design, implement, deploy, and maintain machine learning solutions for given business problems.One way to look at data science versus machine learning engineering is to consider science versus engineering itself. Science gears toward research, and engineering gears toward production. As machine learning moves beyond just the research side, companies are eager for a return on investment in hiring around AI and ML. According to payscale.com and glassdoor.com, the results show that at the end of 2020, the median salary for a data scientist, data engineer, and machine learning engineer was similar. According to LinkedIn in Q4 of 2020, 191K jobs mentioned cloud, there were 70K data engineering job listings, 55k machine learning engineering job listings, and 20k data science job listings, as shown in Figure 1-1."
